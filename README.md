# How-to-implement-Core-Data-Core-Location-and-Map-Kit-in-an-iOS-app-using-Swift-3.
This is the complete Xcode project of my published app called “Bird Spotter”, which was written in Swift 3 and is currently available for free on the App Store. “Bird Spotter” easily and conveniently allows its users to keep track of all of their favorite birding spots. Users of this app can easily find their exact coordinates, save their locations, add a description to their locations, categorize their locations, add photos for their locations, and pin their locations to a map.  This app is a good example of how to implement Core Data, Core Location, and Map Kit in an iOS app using Swift 3.
